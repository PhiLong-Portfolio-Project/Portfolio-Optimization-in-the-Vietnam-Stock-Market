# Application of Portfolio Optimization in the Vietnam Stock Market
### Intorduction
Creating an optimal investment portfolio that balances maximizing returns and minimizing risk is a key objective for any investor. One of the most influential approaches to this is Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO), introduced by Harry Markowitz. This method introduce the concept of diversification and provide a mathematical framework for managing investments.

This project aims to optimize a stock portfolio in the Vietnam stock market by using MVO and Markowitzâ€™s Efficient Frontier. My goal is to create a portfolio that maximizes returns while in certain risk, demonstrating the practical application of these theories.
